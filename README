Fullscreen hack for Flash Plugin
Author: Alistair Buxton <a.j.buxton@gmail.com>


Why
---

Flash plugin incorrectly determines the fullscreen resolution when using nvidia twinview. 
The result is that fullscreen windows fill the primary monitor, but the video gets scaled as if
the primary monitor had the resolution of the total display area.

How
---

The npviewer script loads the hack with LD_PRELOAD and it patches the XGetGeometry call
which flash uses to determine screen size. If XGetGeometry would return the size of the root
window, the patch causes it to instead return the size of the primary monitor.

*** NOTE: you must enter the sizes of your root window and primary monitor before compiling ***
          (i will fix this later)

Config
------

Edit fullscreenhack.c and change the #defines.

Build and Install
-----------------

make && sudo make install
